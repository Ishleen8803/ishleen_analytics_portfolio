**Tools:** Python, Excel Solver, pandas, matplotlib  
**Techniques:** Price elasticity estimation, constrained optimisation, scenario analysis  

## Overview
Developed a pricing optimisation model to determine the most profitable price points for different customer segments under operational constraints. The analysis focused on improving revenue through elasticity estimation and optimisation-based decision modelling.

## Approach
- Estimated **price elasticity of demand** through regression analysis on sales and pricing data.  
- Built a **revenue optimisation model** using Excel Solver and Python to maximise total revenue subject to capacity and cost constraints.  
- Conducted **scenario analysis** to compare baseline pricing, discounted pricing, and premium strategies.  
- Visualised demand and revenue curves to explain findings in a clear, business-oriented format.

## Results
- Identified optimal prices that could increase overall revenue by **12–15%** compared to baseline pricing.  
- Quantified elasticity coefficients to reveal high- and low-sensitivity product categories.  
- Provided recommendations on dynamic pricing and product bundling for sustainable revenue growth.

## Impact
Demonstrated ability to apply **quantitative modelling and optimisation** to business pricing problems.  
Strengthened understanding of **data-driven commercial strategy**, bridging technical analytics and managerial decision-making.
