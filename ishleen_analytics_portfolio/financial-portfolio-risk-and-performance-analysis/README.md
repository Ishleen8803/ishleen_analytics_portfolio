**Tools:** Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn  
**Techniques:** Portfolio optimisation, risk-return analysis, Sharpe ratio, CAPM modelling, regression analysis  

## Overview
This project analysed the risk-return characteristics of equity portfolios and identified the optimal allocation strategy using historical financial data.  
The objective was to evaluate portfolio performance, assess diversification benefits, and apply quantitative methods to support investment decisions.

## Approach
- Loaded and pre-processed 25 Fama-French portfolios data to analyse returns and risk factors.  
- Computed key performance indicators such as **mean returns, standard deviation, beta, and Sharpe ratio** for each portfolio.  
- Conducted **regression-based CAPM analysis** to measure sensitivity to market risk and estimate alpha performance.  
- Built and visualised the **efficient frontier** using Python to identify optimal portfolio weights that maximise return for a given risk level.  
- Evaluated **portfolio diversification effects** and the impact of size and value factors on risk-adjusted returns.

## Results
- Identified optimal portfolios that achieved **higher Sharpe ratios (0.65–0.72)** compared to the market benchmark.  
- Demonstrated the trade-off between small-value and large-growth portfolios under different risk appetites.  
- Validated the CAPM model with **R² ≈ 0.82**, confirming strong explanatory power of market risk on portfolio returns.  
- Visualised portfolio performance, risk distribution, and efficient frontier to support investment recommendations.

## Impact
Demonstrated the ability to apply **financial analytics and quantitative modelling** for investment analysis and risk management.  
Showcased skills in **Python-based financial computation, data visualisation, and strategic insight generation** relevant to real-world portfolio optimisation.
