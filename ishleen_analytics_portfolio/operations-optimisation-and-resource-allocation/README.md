# Operations Optimisation and Resource Allocation Model
 
[View Model](optimisation-spreadsheet.xlsx)

**Tools:** Excel Solver, linear programming, integer programming  
**Techniques:** Resource allocation, cost minimisation, sensitivity analysis, scenario optimisation  

## Overview
This project involved developing and solving a series of optimisation models to support operational decision-making for a manufacturing and logistics scenario.  
The goal was to optimise resource allocation, production scheduling, and cost efficiency under real business constraints.

## Approach
- Formulated **linear and integer programming models** for production, workforce allocation, and distribution decisions.  
- Designed objective functions to **minimise total operational cost** while ensuring demand fulfilment, capacity limits, and logical constraints.  
- Implemented the models in **Excel Solver**, testing multiple operational scenarios to assess sensitivity to cost, capacity, and demand changes.  
- Produced clean solution tables, shadow price interpretations, and managerial recommendations.

## Results
- Identified optimal resource allocation strategies that reduced operational cost by **12–18%** across key scenarios.  
- Demonstrated capacity bottlenecks and quantified the value of additional resources using **dual values and sensitivity analysis**.  
- Delivered clear decision recommendations on production shifts, sourcing strategy, and capacity expansion.

## Impact
Showcased strength in **operations research, optimisation modelling, and structured problem-solving**.  
Demonstrated ability to translate mathematical models into actionable operational insights for real-world decision support.
