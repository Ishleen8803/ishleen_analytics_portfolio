# Analytics Portfolio | Ishleen Kaur

This portfolio showcases applied analytics work developed during my MSc in Business Analytics at Warwick.  
The projects reflect my training in statistical modelling, optimisation, financial analysis, database design, forecasting, and applied machine learning.

Each folder contains a standalone project with its report, supporting code, and a short technical summary.

## Projects Overview

### **1. E-commerce Review Sentiment Prediction**
[`ecommerce-review-sentiment-prediction`](./ecommerce-review-sentiment-prediction)
Built a sentiment prediction framework for customer reviews using text analytics and machine-learning techniques.  
Included feature engineering, model comparison, and insight generation for commercial applications.

### **2. EV Strategy and Business Simulation Analysis**
[`ev-strategy-and-business-simulation-analysis`](./ev-strategy-and-business-simulation-analysis)
Analysed the performance of an electric-vehicle strategy within a six-year business simulation.  
Evaluated pricing decisions, market dynamics, operational constraints, and financial outcomes.

### **3. Exploratory Statistics and Predictive Modelling in R**
[`exploratory-statistics-and-predictive-modelling-in-r`](./exploratory-statistics-and-predictive-modelling-in-r)
Investigated key drivers of customer behaviour using regression, hypothesis testing, and statistical modelling.  
Delivered evidence-based recommendations supported by rigorous R-based analysis.

### **4. Financial Portfolio Risk and Performance Analysis**
[`financial-portfolio-risk-and-performance-analysis`](./financial-portfolio-risk-and-performance-analysis)
Examined the risk–return profile of Fama–French equity portfolios.  
Built CAPM models, assessed diversification benefits, and identified optimal allocations through efficient-frontier modelling.

### **5. Inflation Forecasting and Money Expectations (VAR Model)**
[`inflation_forecasting_money_expectations_var`](./inflation_forecasting_money_expectations_var)
Constructed a multivariate time-series model (VAR) to forecast inflation expectations.  
Assessed lag structures, stability, and economic interpretation of macro-level indicators.

### **6. Operations Optimisation and Resource Allocation**
[`operations-optimisation-and-resource-allocation`](./operations-optimisation-and-resource-allocation)
Formulated and solved optimisation problems using linear and integer programming.  
Delivered resource-allocation strategies tailored to operational constraints.

### **7. Relational Database Design and ETL Pipeline**
[`relational-database-design-and-etl-pipeline`](./relational-database-design-and-etl-pipeline)
Designed a full relational database and implemented an ETL process for a retail business case.  
Produced an ERD, SQL transformations, and business insights through analytical queries.

### **8. SVM Development and Optimisation**
[`svm-development-and-optimisation`](./svm-development-and-optimisation)
Developed and tuned Support Vector Machine models for a classification problem.  
Compared kernels, evaluated performance metrics, and discussed model selection.

### **9. A/B Testing and Statistical Evaluation of AI-Driven Loan Models**
[`a-b-testing-and-statistical-evaluation-of-ai-driven-loan-decision-models`](./a-b-testing-and-statistical-evaluation-of-ai-driven-loan-decision-models)
Evaluated an AI-assisted loan-decision tool through A/B testing, hypothesis testing, effect-size calculations, and OEC modelling.  
Assessed improvements in accuracy, confidence, and alignment with AI recommendations.

### **10. Dynamic Pricing and Revenue Optimisation**
[`dynamic-pricing-and-revenue-optimisation-model`](./dynamic-pricing-and-revenue-optimisation-model)
Built a demand-constrained revenue optimisation model and produced pricing recommendations supported by scenario and sensitivity analysis.
