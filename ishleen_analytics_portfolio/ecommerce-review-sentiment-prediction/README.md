**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, nltk  
**Techniques:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model evaluation  

## Overview
Developed a predictive analytics model to classify customer review sentiments for an eCommerce platform, **Nile**, using natural language and behavioural data.  
The goal was to understand how text-based feedback and numerical ratings correlate with overall customer satisfaction.

## Approach
- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing** on 10,000+ customer reviews, including text tokenisation, lemmatisation, and stopword removal.  
- Engineered linguistic and numerical features such as word frequency, sentiment polarity, and rating differences.  
- Trained and evaluated multiple **machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) to predict review polarity.  
- Applied **cross-validation** and **grid search** for hyperparameter tuning to optimise accuracy and interpretability.  
- Visualised model performance through confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance plots.

## Results
- Achieved **88% accuracy** with the final Random Forest classifier.  
- Identified **sentiment polarity and rating deviation** as the strongest predictors of review sentiment.  
- Produced actionable insights for improving product categorisation and customer satisfaction monitoring.

## Impact
Showcased ability to apply **machine learning and text analytics** to solve a real-world business problem.  
Demonstrated full workflow proficiency — from **data cleaning and feature engineering** to **model validation and insight presentation**.
