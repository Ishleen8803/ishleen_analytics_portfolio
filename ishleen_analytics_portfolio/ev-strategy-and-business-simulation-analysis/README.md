**Tools:** Excel, Tableau (for analysis visualisation), simulation analytics dashboard  
**Techniques:** Strategic decision-making, financial analysis, operations management, sustainability analytics  

## Overview
This project involved managing a simulated global automotive company, **AutoCrats**, across multiple quarters to design and implement a long-term strategy for transitioning from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs).  
The goal was to maximise firm value by balancing profitability, sustainability, and innovation within a competitive industry landscape.

## Approach
- Managed key business functions including **Finance, Operations, Marketing, HR, and Innovation**, using an integrated simulation platform.  
- Developed and implemented a **data-driven EV expansion strategy**, optimising production allocation, marketing spend, and R&D investments across global regions (USA, Europe, and Asia).  
- Analysed quarterly performance using metrics such as **Value Added, EBIT, CO₂ emissions, utilisation, and market share**.  
- Conducted **scenario-based decision reviews**, evaluating trade-offs between short-term profitability and long-term sustainability.  
- Reflected on team collaboration, leadership, and decision alignment through structured analysis and feedback.

## Results
- Achieved strong **EV portfolio growth** and improved financial stability following product reallocation and cost optimisation.  
- Reduced CO₂ penalties by **over 60%** through sustainability investments and discontinuation of high-emission models.  
- Improved **Value Added performance** after strategic restructuring of product lines and pricing strategy in later quarters.  
- Enhanced cross-functional coordination, integrating marketing, finance, and operations for better strategic alignment.

## Impact
Demonstrated ability to **analyse business performance holistically**, integrating financial, operational, and environmental data to drive strategy.  
Showcased strengths in **data-informed decision-making, sustainability strategy, and leadership in cross-functional contexts** — essential skills for analyst and consulting roles.
