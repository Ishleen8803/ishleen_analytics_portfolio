## Overview
Developed an end-to-end relational database and ETL workflow for **Prophecy**, a fictional eCommerce retailer specialising in streetwear.  
The goal was to improve data accessibility across customer management, inventory tracking, promotions, fulfilment, and financial operations.

## Approach
- Designed a fully normalised **Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD)** covering customers, orders, products, payments, suppliers, and promotions.
- Built and validated **relational schema** in SQLite using primary keys, foreign keys, and referential constraints.
- Designed an **ETL pipeline** to extract, clean, transform, and load raw business data into the database.
- Wrote analytical **SQL queries** to generate business insights on customer spending, order trends, supplier performance, and operational efficiency.
- Created a management-focused final presentation summarising the data architecture and key insights.

## Results
- Delivered a production-ready relational database with **structured tables and validated relationships**.
- Identified high-value customers, seasonal sales patterns, low-stock products, and supplier profitability using SQL-driven analytics.
- Highlighted opportunities to improve inventory planning, promotional targeting, and order fulfilment efficiency.
- Built a data product that supports customer segmentation, marketing optimisation, and logistics management.

## Impact
Demonstrated strong capability in **SQL, database design, ETL, and business insight generation**, aligning data infrastructure with real operational needs.  
Provided a scalable data foundation supporting Prophecy’s analytics, reporting, and decision-making processes.
