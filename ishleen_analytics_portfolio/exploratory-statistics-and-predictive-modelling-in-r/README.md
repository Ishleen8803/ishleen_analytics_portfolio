**Tools:** R, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, lm()  
**Techniques:** Hypothesis testing, regression modelling, correlation analysis, ANOVA, data visualisation  

## Overview
This project involved conducting exploratory and inferential data analysis using R to identify significant relationships between business variables and predict performance outcomes.  
It was completed in two stages — an **Exploratory Analysis** and a **Predictive Modelling Analysis**.

## Approach
- Conducted **data cleaning and descriptive analysis** to understand key distributions, central tendencies, and correlations.  
- Performed **hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA)** to identify statistically significant differences between groups.  
- Built multiple **linear regression models** to predict numerical outcomes and assess variable importance.  
- Evaluated model accuracy using **R², adjusted R², and p-values**, and visualised model fit using diagnostic plots.  
- Applied **confidence intervals and residual analysis** to validate model reliability.

## Results
- Identified strong linear relationships between sales, advertising spend, and product quality metrics.  
- Validated hypotheses with **p < 0.05**, confirming significance in predictor variables across categories.  
- Regression models explained up to **78% of variance (Adjusted R² = 0.78)**, indicating strong predictive power.  
- Visualised results through heatmaps, scatter plots, and residual diagnostics for interpretability.

## Impact
Demonstrated ability to translate **statistical findings into business insights** and **use R for predictive decision-making**.  
Strengthened understanding of applied statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression modelling for business analytics.
